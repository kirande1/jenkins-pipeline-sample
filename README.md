# Simple Java Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project contains a simple Java-based pipeline that processes input data and produces an output. The pipeline is designed to demonstrate basic data processing functionality using Java.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management and building the project)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kirande/jenkins-pipeline-sample.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-java-pipeline
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/jenkins-pipeline-sample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
2. Provide input data as prompted (or configure input files as needed).
3. The pipeline will process the data and output the results to the console or a specified file.

## Project Structure
- `src/main/java/com/example/HelloWorld.java`: Main pipeline logic.
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file for dependencies and build settings.

## Example
The pipeline runs a greet method, compile, test, and package the application into a JAR artifact.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a pull request.
